# CS Go Radio Panel

CS GO by default limits the radio commands that you can use in your in-game radio panel. But there is definitely a way, by which we can add more commands.

Follow these simple steps for achieving this.
1. Download the `radiopanel.txt` file.
2. Open the folder where you have installed `steam`.
3. Now in the `steam` directory, go to `>steamapps>csgo>resource>ui>radiopanel`.
4. Replace the `radiopanel.txt` file with the one you downloaded.
5. Make sure you take a backup of the existing file in case you face any issues.

```
Note - Most of these commands will work but it completely depends on the agent you are using.
